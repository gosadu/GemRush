**STAGE 13 UNITY INSTRUCTIONS (EXTREMELY DETAILED, NO CODE)**

Below are the **Unity setup steps** for **Stage 13** of the puzzle-RPG blueprint, which covers **Leaderboards & PvP System**. This involves setting up **LeaderboardManager** for local or global high scores, plus **PvPManager** for asynchronous defense logic. We’ll reference synergy expansions, cameo illusions usage hooking if relevant, forging synergy combos if your PvP system factors them in. **No code** or designer text—**only** step-by-step instructions. After reading, say “Next” for Stage 14.

---

## 1. **Scene / Manager Setup**

1. Open your **TownHubScene** or create a new “PvPScene.unity” if you prefer isolating PvP.  
2. Ensure you have a `[Managers]` object or create a new `[LeaderboardsAndPvPManagers]`.

---

## 2. **Leaderboards & LeaderboardManager**

1. On the `[Managers]` object, **Add Component** → **“LeaderboardManager.”**  
2. The Inspector typically shows:
   - A `leaderboard` list (with `LeaderboardEntry` objects).
   - A `maxEntries` integer.  
3. You can leave `leaderboard` empty at first. The code typically populates it when you call `(Code omitted—focusing solely on instructions).SubmitScore(...)`.

### UI for Leaderboard
1. Create a **Canvas** or a panel named “LeaderboardUI.”  
2. Inside it, add a **Text** or a **ScrollView** to display top entries.  
3. You might have a “RefreshLeaderboardButton” that calls your bridging script to do `(Code omitted—focusing solely on instructions).GetTopEntries(10)` and updates the UI text.  
4. No code is posted here, but ensure your UI flow can show each entry’s `playerID` and `score`.

---

## 3. **PvPManager Setup**

1. On the same `[Managers]` or a new object, **Add Component** → “PvPManager.”  
2. The Inspector might show:
   - A list `defenseList` of “PvPDefenseSetup,” each with `playerID, synergyMultiplier, realmTierFactor, puzzleHazardRate`.  
3. Typically, you can set up a default defense for your own test user:
   - e.g., “PlayerID=Alice, synergyMultiplier=1.0f, realmTierFactor=1.0f, puzzleHazardRate=10.”

### UI for PvP
1. If you want a separate panel “PvPUI,” create a Canvas object named “PvPUI.”  
2. Inside, you might have:
   - An InputField for `playerIDField`.
   - A button “SetDefense.”  
   - Another InputField “challengeDefenderField.”  
   - A “Challenge” button.  
3. In **OnClick**, the bridging script calls `(Code omitted—focusing solely on instructions).SetDefense(...)` or `(Code omitted—focusing solely on instructions).ChallengeDefense(...)`.  
   - The code ensures synergy expansions references or cameo illusions usage hooking if triggered.

---

## 4. **Linking LeaderboardManager and PvPManager**

1. If code calls “LeaderboardManager.Instance.SubmitScore(challengerID, finalScore)” inside PvP logic, ensure both managers are in the scene.  
2. For test purposes:
   - In **PvPManager** Inspector, you might keep the `defenseList` empty except for one or two test defenders.  
   - Then “Challenge” them, watch logs to see if `LeaderboardManager` is updated.

---

## 5. **Cameo illusions usage hooking in PvP** (Optional)

1. If you want cameo illusions usage hooking on big PvP wins, you can pass cameo illusions usage hooking references in code.  
2. Unity side: just confirm `ProjectionSummonManager` is in your scene, and **PvPManager** has the cameo illusions usage hooking field assigned if the code requires it.  
3. Tweak synergy expansions references if your code sets synergy multipliers or cameo illusions usage hooking triggers at high realmTierFactor.

---

## 6. **Testing Leaderboard**

1. **Save** your scene, press **Play**.  
2. In the UI, set your defense: “playerID=Alice, synergyMultiplier=1.2, puzzleHazardRate=15.”  
3. Another user (like “Bob”) challenges “Alice,” yielding a final score.  
4. Check the **Console** for logs about “SubmitScore(bob, finalScore).”  
5. If you have a “RefreshLeaderboard” button, confirm you see Bob’s score. Possibly “1. Bob - 68.”

---

## 7. **Balance & Gating**

1. If synergy expansions or cameo illusions usage hooking affects PvP logic (like `realmTierFactor` or forging synergy combos), ensure you have the correct references.  
2. For local testing, you might set `maxEntries=10` in LeaderboardManager or auto-challenge yourself.

---

## 8. **Version Control**

1. **Save** your scene.  
2. `git add .`, then `git commit -m "Stage 13: Leaderboards & PvP System Setup"`.
