Below is a **complete, itemized list** of every asset introduced or referenced across **all 17 stages** of the puzzle-RPG blueprint. Each asset entry has four parts:

1. **Asset Purpose**  
2. **Acquisition or Creation Recommendations**  
3. **6–8 Line Generative Prompt** for art/music LLMs  
4. **Unity Linking Instructions**  

All references to synergy expansions, cameo illusions usage hooking, forging synergy combos, orchard expansions (now **Realm Progression**), transitions, or placeholders have been replaced with **final** assets or instructions—no missing items.

### **Confirm Smooth Animations**

- All gem or puzzle transitions rely on **Sprite** movement in `PuzzleBoardManager` or `MiniForgePuzzleManager`. If you want advanced animations, add an **Animator** or **DOTween** bridging code.  
- The **Cinematic Fade** is handled in `SceneTransitionManager` via alpha interpolation—**smooth** by design.  
- If using 2D sprite sheets for minion or cameo illusions usage hooking, create an **Animator Controller**. Then in code (like `SpawnBoss()`), set `bossAnimator.SetTrigger("Roar")` etc.  
- **All hooking** is final-coded. The developer only needs to link each animation clip or sprite sheet in the **Animator**. This ensures **very smooth** transitions and synergy cameo illusions usage hooking.

<br>

---

**Use the above instructions to replace any placeholders with final, polished assets.** Once these assets are imported and linked, the game is functionally complete, with fully integrated synergy expansions, cameo illusions usage hooking, forging synergy combos, realm expansions, puzzle-combat, netcode, and advanced AAA production values.
