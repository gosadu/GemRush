**STAGE 2 ASSET LIST**  
*(Puzzle-Combat Mechanics & Advanced Board Logic)*

Below is a comprehensive catalog of **every** visual or audio asset required in **Stage 2** of the puzzle-RPG blueprint—no code or design/QA text, just the detailed asset list. Each visual asset has a **5–7 line** image prompt; each audio asset has a **2–3 line** audio prompt. Stage 2 introduces gem-based puzzle combat, Radiant/Corrupted gems, synergy references, and cameo illusions usage hooking if your board logic triggers special cameo synergy.  

---

### 1) **Puzzle Board Background**  
- **Usage**: The main 8×8 board backdrop, providing a distinct environment behind the gems. It should not distract from the gems but convey a subtle arcane–fantasy flair.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) A soft gradient fantasy backdrop for an 8×8 puzzle grid
  2) Subtle magical symbols at edges, not cluttering center
  3) Warm teal-to-violet color transition
  4) Gentle painterly brushstrokes, AAA puzzle-RPG level of detail
  5) Light arcane glow effect near corners
  6) Semi-muted so gem colors stand out
  7) Transparent or fade in center area for gem clarity
  ```

---

### 2) **Gem Sprites (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)**  
- **Usage**: Core colored gems for puzzle-combat. Each color denotes synergy references or hero alignment. Typically ~64×64 resolution for clarity, optionally animated with a subtle idle shine.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) Four distinct gem sprites: red, blue, green, yellow
  2) Slightly faceted surfaces, glossy finish
  3) Each with a mild magical aura or subtle animated sparkle
  4) Vibrant jewel-tone color palette
  5) Crisp edges and a prismatic highlight
  6) AAA puzzle-RPG style, coherent design across colors
  7) Transparent background for 2D UI usage
  ```

---

### 3) **Radiant Gem Sprite (Wildcard)**  
- **Usage**: A special wildcard gem that can match any color, awarding synergy combo boosts. Requires a distinct prismatic or rainbow-like effect to stand out.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) A rainbow-sparkling gem with refractive edges
  2) Pulsing prismatic glow in the center
  3) Slight animation frames for shifting color highlights
  4) AAA puzzle-RPG style, ephemeral swirl in background
  5) High contrast between gem facets, shimmering aura
  6) Crisp outline for easy readability at small scale
  7) Radiant “wildcard” vibe, eye-catching brilliance
  ```

---

### 4) **Corrupted Gem Sprite (Hazard)**  
- **Usage**: A malevolent gem that evolves over time, eventually locking adjacent gems. Typically dark, cracked visuals with a subtle pulsation.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) A jagged, dark crystal with crackled neon veins
  2) Faint red or purple glow pulsing inside
  3) Corrupted fantasy aura, ominous arcane fissures
  4) Slightly animated “throb” or flicker effect
  5) AAA puzzle-RPG hazard gem, high detail
  6) Transparent alpha channel for easy layering
  7) Menacing presence compared to regular gems
  ```

---

### 5) **Gem Match SFX**  
- **Usage**: A short “pop” or “chime” whenever 3+ gems match and disappear. Crisp enough to be satisfying but not overbearing during chain combos.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  A bright, short chime with layered sparkles
  Quick fade-out, high-frequency glitter to indicate success
  AAA puzzle-RPG gem match feedback
  ```

---

### 6) **Gem Drop / Cascade SFX**  
- **Usage**: A soft whoosh or trickling sound each time new gems spawn or cascade into empty slots.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  Gentle cascading sound with a low whoosh and faint twinkle
  Mid-volume, short tail, evoking falling crystals
  AAA puzzle-RPG gem movement ambience
  ```

---

### 7) **Puzzle BGM (Combat Theme)**  
- **Usage**: An upbeat, loopable background track for standard puzzle-combat encounters, matching synergy references or cameo illusions hooking triggers if the cameo appears. Shouldn’t overshadow SFX.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  Mid-tempo orchestral-electronic fusion loop
  Driving percussion, subtle heroic chord progressions
  AAA puzzle-RPG tension with bright melodic flourishes
  ```

---

### 8) **Board Rotation or Advanced Mechanic Cue SFX**  
- **Usage**: A quick swirl or shifting sound effect if the puzzle board rotates or an advanced mechanic triggers. Helps differentiate normal gem matches from special events.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  A dynamic swirling cue with light windwhoosh and arcane twinkle
  Quick, 1-second effect, rising then fading
  AAA puzzle-RPG advanced board mechanic feedback
  ```
