**STAGE 3 ASSET LIST**  
*(Realm Tier Progression & Resource Systems)*

Below is a comprehensive catalog of **every** visual or audio asset required in **Stage 3** of the puzzle-RPG blueprint—no code or design text, just the **detailed asset list**. Each visual asset has a **5–7 line** generative image prompt; each audio asset has a **2–3 line** audio prompt. Stage 3 covers **Realm Tier expansions** (formerly orchard expansions), **resource nodes**, daily minigames, synergy references, cameo illusions usage if relevant, etc.

### 1) **Realm Tier Emblems**  
- **Usage**: Distinct icons or sigils representing each realm’s tier upgrade in the UI. Typically displayed near the “upgrade realm” button or in a realm progress panel.

  3) Vibrant color coding that intensifies with higher tiers
  4) Crisp 2D design, high-resolution for UI scaling

  ```

  ```

### 3) **Daily Resource Node Sprites**  
- **Usage**: In-stage or UI icons for each realm’s daily minigame node (like a “wood logging node,” “metal mining node,” “seed orchard node,” etc.).

  ```
  1) Small sprite set depicting daily gather nodes: a log stump, ore vein, seed bush, arcane bloom
  2) Cartoonish but AAA polish, gentle painterly shading
  3) Clear shapes that pop on top of a 2D background
  4) Subtle arcane swirl or glow effect if synergy expansions are relevant
  5) 2–3 frames of idle animation (like a gentle sway) if possible
  6) Warm color palette, matching puzzle-RPG style
  7) Transparent backgrounds for scene placement
  ```

### 4) **Tier Upgrade Transition VFX**

  7) Crisp edges, high-resolution for UI overlay
  ```

  Subtle harp arpeggios, gentle string chords
  AAA puzzle-RPG realm expansion mood with warm progression

  Bright, pleasant tone, about half a second
  AAA puzzle-RPG resource collection feedback
  ```
