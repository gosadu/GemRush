**STAGE 1 ASSET LIST**  
*(Multiregion World, Town Hub, and Sublocation Infrastructure)*

Below is a comprehensive catalog of **every** visual or audio asset required in **Stage 1** of the puzzle-RPG blueprint—no code or Unity instructions, just the detailed asset list. Each visual asset has an explicit usage explanation and a **5–7 line** image prompt. Each audio asset has an explicit usage explanation and a **2–3 line** generative audio prompt.

---

### 1) **Town Hub Background**  
- **Usage**: A main backdrop for the **TownHubScene**—the player’s starting location. Illustrates a welcoming fantasy outpost or small city, where synergy expansions (realm gating) eventually unlock new sublocations.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) A cozy medieval-fantasy town square at mid-morning
  2) Warm color palette with soft sunlight and gentle shadows
  3) Subtle arcane flourishes on building signs or banners
  4) Mild painterly style, AAA-level detail
  5) Stone pathways, wooden stalls, modest fountain in center
  6) Slight whimsical aura without overcrowded clutter
  7) Background fits a puzzle-RPG town-hub user interface
  ```

### 2) **Overworld/Realm Entry Icons**  
- **Usage**: Small icons or mini-tiles representing each accessible region on the overworld map. Stage 1 only shows the first realm (Town region) plus locked placeholders for additional realms.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) Stylized realm icon set, each a shield-like badge
  2) Simple flat-shaded color blocks with arcane motifs
  3) Subtle fantasy detailing around edges
  4) Warm pastel palette, easy to read at small sizes
  5) Each badge silhouette slightly distinct (locked icons show a gray padlock overlay)
  6) AAA puzzle-RPG consistency with mild highlight or glow
  7) Crisp edges for a 2D user interface
  ```

---

### 3) **Sublocation Icons/Thumbnails**  
- **Usage**: For each Town sublocation (e.g., Tavern, Workshop, Player House, etc.), small icons or thumbnails on the hub screen.  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) A series of small sublocation icons for a medieval-fantasy town
  2) Each icon has distinct shape: tavern mug, workshop anvil, house silhouette
  3) Vibrant colors but not overly saturated
  4) Subtle arcane swirl or motif tying them together
  5) Painted texture, crisp lines, AAA puzzle-RPG style
  6) Transparent backgrounds for easy UI layering
  7) Slight gradient highlights to add depth
  ```

---

### 4) **Simple Transition Overlay (Visual)**  
- **Usage**: A fade or swirl overlay for scene transitions, lightly referenced in Stage 1 for going from the Town Hub to sublocations (Arcane Flow Transitions).  
- **Visual Generative Prompt (5–7 lines)**:
  ```
  1) Minimal swirl overlay texture
  2) Soft magical flourish in corners, semi-transparent
  3) Gradient from light arcane purple to full transparent center
  4) Subtle painterly style, not distracting
  5) AAA-level polish for puzzle-RPG transitions
  6) Crisp edges on swirl lines, alpha-channeled PNG
  7) Gentle swirl arcs that fade gracefully
  ```

---

### 5) **Town Theme (Audio)**  
- **Usage**: The main BGM track looping in the Town Hub. Calm, welcoming vibe with a slight magical undertone, setting the stage for synergy expansions.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  A warm fantasy orchestral loop with gentle strings and light woodwind
  Medium tempo, cozy ambiance, subtle uplifting melody
  AAA puzzle-RPG town theme that evokes exploration and comfort
  ```

---

### 6) **UI Click SFX**  
- **Usage**: Button click or sublocation selection sound effect in the Town Hub’s UI. Distinct yet soft enough to be non-intrusive.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  Subtle, short click with a mild magical sparkle
  Crisp high-end tone, slight chime finish
  AAA puzzle-RPG interface feedback
  ```

---

### 7) **Ambient Town Sound Loop (Audio)**  
- **Usage**: Background ambience (light chatter, distant footsteps, soft breeze) playing under the main Town Theme or separately. Faint enough not to clash with BGM.  
- **Audio Generative Prompt (2–3 lines)**:
  ```
  Gentle medieval town ambiance: soft crowd murmurs, distant wagon wheels
  Low-volume atmospheric loop, light breeze effect
  AAA fantasy setting, subtle immersive background
  ```
