## **STAGE 1: PROJECT CREATION & INITIAL SCENE SETUP**

### **1) Asset: Main Canvas Background**

- **Purpose**:  
  A painterly or subtle anime backdrop for the “MainGame” scene’s UI. It unifies orchard expansions synergy references, forging synergy combos previews, puzzle-combat glimpses, incremental tutorials pop-ups, daily tasks mentions, netcode cameo cameo usage banners, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation logic, hero synergy usage, and top-tier UI design.

- **Generative Prompt (6–8 lines)**:
  ```
  "Create a painterly fantasy background at 1920×1080.
   Use soft pastel strokes in cool greens and blues.
   Incorporate subtle anime influence in line detail.
   Place gentle swirling runes near the borders, hinting at magic.
   Leave open space in the center for UI panels.
   Illuminate faint sunlight from the top-left corner.
   Embed a calm, whimsical tone across all shapes and colors."
  ```

- **Super Verbose Unity Hookup**:
  1. In the Project window, create `Assets/Art/UI/Backgrounds`.  
  2. Import the final PNG (e.g., `MainCanvasBG.png`) into that folder.  
  3. In the “MainGame” scene Hierarchy, create a `Canvas` (if none exists).  
  4. Inside `Canvas`, right-click → UI → Image → rename to `CanvasBackground`.  
  5. In the `RectTransform`, set `anchorMin=(0,0)`, `anchorMax=(1,1)`, pivot `(0.5,0.5)`, sizeDelta `(0,0)`.  
  6. Assign the PNG to the `Image` component’s `Source Image`. Set `Color` alpha=1, disable `Raycast Target`.  
  7. This ensures orchard expansions synergy references or forging synergy combos elements appear over a cohesive painterly BG, with puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks referencing synergy combos, incremental tutorials, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation or hero synergy usage integrated from the start.
