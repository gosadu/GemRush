**SECTION 1: MULTI-REGION WORLD, TOWN HUB, AND SUBLOCATION INFRASTRUCTURE**  
*(Ultra-Granular Developer-Level Detail)*  

---

### 1.1 **World Overview and Progression Logic**  
- **Regions and The Overworld**  
  - The game features **10 primary Regions**, each themed around a particular environment or story arc (e.g., Ember Highlands, Cascade Reaches, Terra Valley).  
  - An **Overworld Map** displays these Regions in a painterly style. Initially, only one Region—**Oakrest** (Region ID=0)—is accessible. The remaining 9 Regions unlock sequentially based on **Realm Tier Progression** milestones or boss completions.  
  - Each of the 10 Regions contains **5 Sublocations**, for a total of **50** distinct sub-areas.  
    - **Example**: Region 1 might have Sublocation 1–5, each containing puzzle-combat nodes, local mini-bosses, daily tasks, or special quest hooks.  
  - **Future Expansions**: Additional or “Hard Mode” Regions (IDs 11–13, etc.) can be unveiled post-launch, either as patch updates or live events.  

- **Region Lock/Unlock Conditions**  
  - Typically, clearing **70%** of the puzzle-combat nodes in a Region’s final sublocation and defeating that sublocation’s boss unlocks the next Region.  
  - Some Regions require certain **Realm Tier Progression** levels (e.g., Region 4 might demand Timberland District Tier 2) to ensure players have adequate gear and resources.  
  - **Teleportation Points** can be permanently unlocked once a Region’s story is completed, allowing players to revisit or skip certain areas.  

#### Developer Focus  
1. **Streamlined Flow**: Each Region is progressively more challenging, requiring players to continually invest in gear (via **Arcane Gear Infusion**) and upgrade their districts through **Realm Tier Progression**.  
2. **Optional Side Nodes**: ~30% of nodes in each sublocation can be purely optional, offering extra rewards but not mandatory for boss unlock. This approach accommodates both casual progress and hardcore farming.  
3. **Data-Driven Scaling**: Enemy HP, Corrupted gem spawn rates, and puzzle hazards in each Region can be dynamically scaled or adjusted server-side.  

---

### 1.2 **Town Hub: Oakrest (Region ID=0)**  
- **Central Location**: Oakrest is the starting Region and the only one available at the game’s launch. It features a single Sublocation, **Adventurer’s Haven**, that contains the core “town” services.  
- **Town Layout**:  
  1. **Main Square**  
     - Contains fundamental NPCs and shops (e.g., a Gold Merchant for minor resource trades, and a Premium Store for gem purchases).  
     - **Quest Board** or **“Daily Planner Access Point”** to highlight all daily/weekly tasks in one interface.  
     - Visual enhancements: set up an **Arcane Flow Transition** effect when moving from the Square to other key structures.  
  2. **Realm Districts Entry**  
     - Access to the **4 Districts** tied to **Realm Tier Progression**. Each District is effectively a sub-hub with its own minigame and resource management UI.  
     - The District Gate might show real-time progression bars, e.g., “Timberland District Tier 2 → Next Upgrade: 80/100 seeds.”  
  3. **Workshop Node**  
     - The forging location for **Arcane Gear Infusion**.  
     - Houses the “4×4 forging puzzle,” forging cost panels, Arcane Infusion success rate displays, and a resource exchange UI.  
  4. **Tavern Node**  
     - Primary location for **Guild & Co-Op** features.  
     - Contains guild chat, guild boss boards, and **Guest Hero Summon** management.  
  5. **Player Room Node**  
     - The player’s personalizable “housing” area.  
     - Trophies from region completions, special furnishings that grant small in-game bonuses (e.g., -5% forging time).  

#### Developer Focus  
1. **Single-Sublocation Architecture**: All core interactions happen within Adventurer’s Haven to reduce overhead. Sub-nodes within the Town can be loaded via smaller scenes or integrated into one scene with multiple UI tabs.  
2. **Arcane Flow Transitions**: Consistent visual transitions when entering the Workshop, Player Room, or District Gate to unify the game’s style.  
3. **Adaptive Audio Layers**: The Town can have a base music track that layers in additional ambiance in each sub-node.  

---

### 1.3 **Sublocation Design & Node Distribution**  
- **Sublocation Composition**  
  - Each Region has **5 Sublocations** with **10–40** puzzle-combat nodes each. The variety in node count accommodates different pacing (e.g., early sublocations might have only 10–15 nodes, later ones 30–40).  
  - Each Sublocation typically includes:  
    - **3–6 Normal Minion Nodes**  
    - **1–2 Elite or Mini-Boss Nodes**  
    - **1 “Main Boss” Node** (often at the final sublocation)  
    - **Optional Resource Farming Nodes** or “shortcuts” that appear for 8 hours after initial completion.  
- **Node Clearance & Respawn**  
  - Once cleared, a node remains passable for **8 hours**, then respawns with slightly randomized puzzle parameters (gem spawn rates, Corrupted gem frequencies, and minion compositions).  
  - If a node’s “boss” is defeated, the boss typically does not respawn with full HP unless the region is reset in **Hard Mode** or a special event.  
- **Teleport Event Nodes**  
  - Unlocked upon **100% clearing** a sublocation, letting players skip repeated minion fights if they revisit that sublocation.  
  - Can be monetized with skip tokens or integrated as a free convenience for high-tier players.  

#### Developer Focus  
1. **Controlled Complexity**: Keeping the sublocation structure standardized ensures a single developer can manage the content pipeline.  
2. **Procedural Variation**: Basic minions or Corrupted gem rates can be pulled from a data table, so repeated node clearances remain fresh without requiring unique design each time.  
3. **Endgame Revisits**: Hard or “Remixed” modes can repurpose these Sublocations without adding new art or massive new code.

---

### 1.4 **Puzzle-Combat Node Implementation**  
- **Entry Flow**  
  1. Player taps a node on the Sublocation map.  
  2. **Arcane Flow Transition** effect while loading the puzzle board.  
  3. Pre-fight screen shows recommended power, synergy tips, or optional difficulty modifiers (e.g., +25% HP for enemies in exchange for +10% gold).  
- **Combat Execution**  
  1. **8×8** real-time gem board.  
  2. Timed HP drain (varies by mode).  
  3. Minions or boss inflict extra damage at fixed intervals.  
  4. **Corrupted Gems** evolve over time, Radiant gems accelerate the combo meter.  
  5. **Phantasm Surge** triggers at 50 combo points, removing 2 Corrupted gems and boosting synergy for 8 seconds.  
- **Post-Battle Rewards**  
  - Gold, resource materials (seeds, wood, ore, blossoms, forging catalysts), hero XP, skill XP.  
  - Potential forging components for **Arcane Gear Infusion** or **Realm Tier Progression**.  
  - A “battle summary UI” detailing combos performed, total damage, synergy triggers used.  

---

### 1.5 **Scaling & Feasibility**  
- **Single-Developer Maintenance**  
  - Each Region is structured around the same template: 5 Sublocations × ~10–40 nodes.  
  - Variation is data-based: enemy stats, spawn tables for Corrupted gems, and synergy triggers.  
- **Data Scripting**  
  - Use JSON or scriptable objects for each Sublocation’s node layout.  
  - Mark which nodes are boss fights, elite fights, or resource “farming” nodes.  
  - Mark gating conditions (e.g., “Require Arcane Bloom District Tier 2 to attempt Node #25”).  
- **Potential Monetization Spots**  
  - **Node Skips**: A small premium cost to instantly bypass minion waves.  
  - **Boss Challenge**: Optional “Double Rewards” if the player spends a small premium token to activate a harder variant of the boss.  

---

### 1.6 **Detailed Numeric Examples & Developer Notes**  
1. **Example Region & Sublocation**  
   - **Region 1: Ember Highlands**  
     - Sublocation 1: Ember Outskirts (10 nodes)  
     - Sublocation 2: Blistering Canyon (12 nodes)  
     - Sublocation 3: Charred Grove (15 nodes)  
     - Sublocation 4: Fiery Summit (15 nodes)  
     - Sublocation 5: Lavaheart Keep (Boss Lair, 20 nodes)  
   - Typical minion stats here might be 60–80 HP, 3–4 DPS. Boss ~600 HP, 8 DPS, spawns +5% Corrupted gems.  
   - Clearing 70% of Sublocation 5’s nodes unlocks the boss.  
2. **Node Respawn Timer**  
   - 8 hours from clearing. E.g., if the player kills the boss at 10 AM, that node’s minions reappear at 6 PM, with some random changes in gem distribution.  
   - The boss remains “conquered” but can be re-challenged in a “Hard Mode” after the entire region is completed or reset.  
3. **Teleport Unlock Condition**  
   - If a player clears 100% of Charred Grove, they gain a teleport circle letting them skip Ember Outskirts and Blistering Canyon entirely when returning to fight in Sublocation 3 or beyond.  

---

#### **Rationale for Maximizing Engagement & Revenue**  
- This multi-region layout keeps the game map feeling expansive while controlling dev workload via repeated design templates.  
- Inter-node gating with **Realm Tier Progression** ensures that players must return to Oakrest to invest in District upgrades or attempt forging with **Arcane Gear Infusion** to remain powerful enough for deeper nodes.  
- The combination of puzzle skill, resource management, and gating fosters daily logins, driving potential premium purchases (resources, skip tokens, forging success boosters).  

---

### 1.7 **Section 1 Conclusion**  
The multi-region structure, anchored by a single town hub (Oakrest) and subdivided into manageable puzzle-combat sublocations, provides a robust yet feasible world layout. Data-driven design allows a single developer to maintain or expand content rapidly. The combination of standard node clearance, boss gating, and integration with **Realm Tier Progression** sets a compelling foundation for the puzzle-RPG’s overarching structure.

**SECTION 2: PUZZLE-COMBAT MECHANICS & ADVANCED BOARD LOGIC**  
*(Ultra-Granular Developer-Level Detail)*  

---

### 2.1 **Real-Time Puzzle Board Foundations**  
1. **Grid Size & Layout**  
   - An **8×8** grid is used for all standard encounters. Each cell can contain one gem of six possible types (Ember, Cascade, Terra, Zephyr, Radiant, or Corrupted).  
   - **Adaptive Difficulty Tables** can modify gem distribution based on the node or region, ensuring deeper regions or boss nodes have increased Corrupted gem spawn rates.  

2. **Initial Gem Seeding**  
   - At the start of combat, the board randomly populates with elemental gems (Ember/Cascade/Terra/Zephyr) at an approximate distribution of 80–90% total.  
   - **Radiant** gems appear at a small base chance (2–3%).  
   - **Corrupted** gems can appear at 5–10% chance in standard nodes, but can go up to 15–20% in advanced or boss nodes.  
   - If the board spawns a match of 3 or more gems at the very start, those gems are cleared automatically before combat begins, to avoid freebies.  

3. **Single-Developer Feasibility**  
   - The board logic is entirely data-driven. A single script can handle gem spawning, matching detection, combo calculations, and time-based evolutions.  
   - Each region or boss can use a reference to a data table specifying the target gem spawn rates, Corrupted gem evolution time, and puzzle speed multipliers.  

---

### 2.2 **Time-Based Mechanics & HP Drain**  
1. **HP Drain Over Time**  
   - **Casual Mode**: -1 HP every 5 seconds.  
   - **Standard Mode**: -1 HP every 3 seconds.  
   - **Hardcore Mode**: -1 HP every 1 second.  
   - Each puzzle node can override these values if needed (e.g., boss nodes might enforce Standard or Hardcore).  
2. **Enemy Damage Tick**  
   - Certain minions or bosses inflict DPS separate from HP drain. For example, a minion might deal 1–4 DPS, while a boss deals 5–10 DPS. These ticks occur every second or in discrete intervals (e.g., every 2 seconds) based on node data.  
   - Some advanced bosses also apply a short spike in damage whenever a Corrupted gem evolves to Phase 2 or 3.  
3. **Time-Acceleration Factors**  
   - Certain synergy effects (e.g., a Zephyr 5-gem match) can speed up or slow down the overall board rotation but do not alter the HP drain clock.  
   - Developer can add special node modifiers (like “Time Warp Node”) that speed up or slow down the entire board by 10–20%. This is toggled via a data flag.  

---

### 2.3 **Matching & Combo Meter**  
1. **Basic Matching Rule**  
   - Swapping adjacent gems forms a match if 3 or more identical elemental gems (or Radiant) are lined up horizontally or vertically.  
   - Radiant gems can pair with any color, significantly increasing the likelihood of large matches.  
2. **Combo Meter Increments**  
   - +1 to the combo meter per standard gem matched.  
   - **Radiant** gems add +2 each (1 normal +1 bonus).  
   - Chain reactions from falling gems can increase the meter further within the same move.  
   - **Example**: A single move that triggers three separate matches in a cascade might yield (3 + 4 + 4) = 11 matched gems. If 2 of those are Radiant, the final contribution is 11 base + 2 (bonus) = 13 to the combo meter.  
3. **Phantasm Surge Threshold**  
   - The combo meter caps at 50 in normal puzzle-combat. Once it hits 50 within a single chain or wave of matches, **Phantasm Surge** triggers.  
   - The meter resets to 0 after the Surge ends (8-second duration), though new combos can build toward triggering another Surge if the match volume is large enough.  

---

### 2.4 **Phantasm Surge (Combo ≥ 50)**  
1. **Activation & Duration**  
   - Triggers automatically upon reaching 50 combo points.  
   - Lasts **8 seconds** by default, but can be extended by multi-element synergy (up to +3 seconds if the party is 4 distinct elements).  
2. **Immediate Effects**  
   - Removes **2 Corrupted Gems** from the board instantly.  
   - Boosts all damage by **+10%** during the Surge window.  
   - Any **5+ gem match** within this window spawns **1 new Radiant gem** at a random empty cell on the board.  
3. **Surge End**  
   - The combo meter resets to 0. The normal board state resumes. If the player manages another 50 points in quick succession, a second Surge can occur.  

**Developer Note**: The presence of Radiant gems (especially if gear or synergy buffs raise Radiant spawn rates) can create a near back-to-back Surge chain. This is intentional for high-level combos and fosters excitement during boss fights.

---

### 2.5 **Corrupted Gem Evolution & Removal**  
1. **Phases**  
   - **Phase 1**: Harmless. Remains for 5 seconds before evolving to Phase 2.  
   - **Phase 2**: Deals minor area damage or a set DPS spike if left another 5 seconds. Then evolves to Phase 3.  
   - **Phase 3**: Explodes, locking adjacent gems for **3 seconds** and dealing a larger HP hit (e.g., 5 HP or more). The Corrupted gem then vanishes.  
2. **Removal Methods**  
   - Corrupted gems cannot be matched away by standard element combos.  
   - **Phantasm Surge** automatically removes 2 per activation.  
   - Certain gear from **Arcane Gear Infusion** or synergy unlocks via **Realm Tier Progression** (e.g., T3 in Seed Grove or T3 in Miner’s Gulch) can revert or remove Corrupted gems if a 4+ match or 5-gem match is made in the board.  
3. **Developer Tuning**  
   - Each node or boss can define how quickly Corrupted gems evolve (e.g., 4 seconds or 6 seconds instead of 5).  
   - Corrupted gem spawn rate can scale from ~5% in early game to ~20% in late-game or hard-mode nodes.  

---

### 2.6 **Board Rotation & Arcane Flow Transitions**  
1. **Periodic Board Rotation**  
   - Every **9 seconds** in standard puzzle fights (if no active matches or cascades), the board rotates 90°.  
   - Rotation can be sped up or delayed by certain synergy effects, especially from Zephyr gear or hero abilities.  
   - Rotations may cause new matches or separate existing ones, drastically changing the board state.  
2. **Arcane Flow Transitions** (During Combat Waves)  
   - For multi-wave encounters, an **Arcane Flow Transition** can play between waves (1–2 seconds) while the board remains partially locked. The next wave’s minions/boss appear at the edge of the screen or as an overlay.  
   - Visually consistent swirling energy ties thematically to the Arcane aspects of the game.  
3. **Performance & Implementation**  
   - This effect is typically a shader-based swirl or fade-out/fade-in. The puzzle grid itself can remain in memory while the swirl effect is shown on top.  
   - Minimizes load times and fosters visual continuity.  

---

### 2.7 **Damage Calculation & Elemental Synergy**  
1. **Base Damage Formula**  
   \[
   \text{Damage} = 
   \Bigl(\text{BaseAttack} + \text{GearBonus} + \text{RoleBonus}\Bigr)
   \times \Bigl(\text{GemMatchFactor} + \text{ElementBoost} + \text{ComboChainFactor}\Bigr)
   - \text{EnemyDefense}
   \]  
   - **BaseAttack**: Determined by hero stats (average or sum of party?).  
   - **GearBonus**: Items forged via **Arcane Gear Infusion** can add a flat or percentage bonus.  
   - **RoleBonus**: If roles are balanced (Attacker, Defender, Support, Utility), or if the hero’s role matches the gem color.  
   - **GemMatchFactor**: +1.0 for 3-gem match, +1.5 for 4, +2.0 for 5, and +0.5 for each gem above 5.  
   - **ElementBoost**: +0.2 per hero in the party of that element. (If 2 Ember heroes match Ember gems, +0.4, etc.)  
   - **ComboChainFactor**: +0.1 per chain within the same move.  
2. **Mono vs Multi-Element Party**  
   - **Mono**: If all 4 heroes share the same element, add +10% to that element’s gem-based damage.  
   - **Multi**: 3 distinct elements +2 seconds to Phantasm Surge, 4 distinct +3 seconds total.  
3. **Radiant Modifiers**  
   - Radiant gems are wildcard for color matching, but use the damage factor of the majority color in that match. If the match is purely Radiant (rare scenario), treat it as a neutral element dealing standard damage.  

---

### 2.8 **Reward Drops & Resource Flow**  
1. **Resource Categories**  
   - **Gold**: Standard currency. Dropped from minions/bosses, used for realm upgrades or forging fees.  
   - **Materials**: Seeds, wood, ore, blossoms, forging catalysts, or synergy shards. Tied to **Realm Tier Progression** and used for **Arcane Gear Infusion**.  
   - **Hero XP**: Directly raises hero levels.  
   - **Skill XP**: Logging, Mining, Gathering, Combat. Each puzzle victory yields small increments based on node difficulty.  
2. **Drop Tables**  
   - Each node references a drop table that might yield 1–2 resource types. Boss nodes offer guaranteed forging mats plus a chance for special gear infusion tokens.  
   - Developer can easily adjust drop rates globally via data for economy tuning.

---

### 2.9 **Advanced Monetization Opportunities**  
1. **Boosters**  
   - Temporary item that increases Radiant gem spawn by +2% for 30 minutes, sold in small premium packs.  
   - “Corruption Cleanser” that automatically removes 1 Corrupted gem every 10 seconds for one puzzle attempt.  
2. **Puzzle Time Extenders**  
   - For Hardcore or timed event nodes, players can buy a +10-second extension if they’re close to winning but run out of HP or time. This must be carefully balanced to avoid pay-to-win backlash.  
3. **Gem Refresh**  
   - In certain encounters, a button to reshuffle the board once per puzzle at a small premium cost.  

---

### 2.10 **Section 2 Conclusion**  
The real-time puzzle-combat system is both accessible and deep, hinging on dynamic mechanics like Corrupted gem evolution, Radiant wildcard bonuses, and a powerful Phantasm Surge. Careful data-driven design lets a single developer balance spawn rates, HP drain speeds, and synergy thresholds on the fly. This fosters an environment ripe for daily engagement, strategic deck-building with elemental synergy, and frequent monetization triggers, all in a cohesive puzzle format.
