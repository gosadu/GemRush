**STAGE 1: PROJECT CREATION & INITIAL MULTI-SCENE SETUP**  
*(Incorporating all original Stage 1 details, plus the added refinements from both Game Designer and QA perspectives. No placeholders remain. By the end of Stage 1, we have a multi-scene foundation with minimal style guidelines, a short narrative intro, baseline QA smoke tests, and a structure that supports orchard expansions synergy, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials, swirl transitions, layered audio, sublocation logic, and hero synergy usage in later stages.)*

---

## **GAME DESIGNER & QA FEEDBACK INTEGRATION**  

1. **Game Designer Enhancements**  
   - **Minimal Style & Color Palette from Day One**: Establish a consistent color scheme (soft fantasy pastel with warm browns and subtle anime lines) so UI can stay cohesive throughout orchard expansions, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation boss logic, hero synergy usage, etc.  
   - **Short Narrative Prologue**: Include a quick “on first launch” cinematic or text story snippet that contextualizes orchard expansions synergy and forging synergy combos. This ensures new players see the fantasy setting’s stakes immediately.  
   - **User Flow**: Confirm that the multi-scene approach (MainMenu, Overworld, PuzzleBattle) is introduced with a short, optional cinematic. The Overworld transitions to orchard expansions synergy tasks or forging combos. The puzzle scene handles orchard synergy or forging synergy references. No placeholders remain.  
   - **Early Monetization Teaser**: Provide a subtle hint—like a “Starter Pack” button on the main menu—that doesn’t overshadow orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos, but seeds the idea of microtransactions.

2. **QA Engineer Enhancements**  
   - **Persistent “Managers Scene” or Single-Scene Reference**: To avoid cross-manager reference issues, use a single persistent GameObject (or “Managers” prefab) loaded at startup. This helps ensure orchard expansions synergy, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking can be tested consistently.  
   - **Baseline Smoke Tests**: Right from Stage 1, implement a minimal script-based test to load each scene, confirm resolution coverage, and check that no missing references or script errors appear. This reduces the risk of multi-scene breakage on different devices.  
   - **Performance & Resolution Checks**: Implement a simple method to log device resolution on first run, ensuring orchard expansions synergy screens or forging synergy combos panels do not overlap or go off-screen on standard phone/tablet ratios.

---

## **STAGE 1 GOALS**  

1. **Project Creation & Folder Structure**:  
   - Unity version 2021+ or a stable LTS recommended.  
   - A clear folder layout to support orchard expansions synergy data, forging synergy combos data, puzzle logic, netcode cameo usage scripts, daily tasks, incremental tutorials assets, swirl transitions, layered audio, sublocation logic, hero synergy usage, UI prefabs, etc.  

2. **Core Scenes**:  
   - **MainMenu.unity**: The painterly title screen, now with a short narrative or cinematic snippet upon first launch.  
   - **Overworld.unity**: Where orchard expansions synergy gating, forging synergy combos references, puzzle entry points, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, netcode cameo cameo usage appear.  
   - **PuzzleBattle.unity**: The puzzle-combat environment supporting orchard synergy weighting or forging synergy combos usage.  

3. **GameManager Setup**:  
   - A single `GameManager` object in a persistent scene or loaded first ensures orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos references remain stable.  
   - Additional managers (UIManager, SoundManager, etc.) also persist so we can test multi-scene transitions from day one.  

4. **Short Narrative Intro**:  
   - A minimal script or cinematic triggers on first launch, introducing the fantasy orchard expansions synergy concept, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic synergy triggers, and guild cameo usage.  

5. **Early QA Smoke Tests**:  
   - Basic script to load each scene in test mode, verifying no missing references or scripts.  
   - Logs device resolution.  

6. **No Placeholders**:  
   - Even at Stage 1, we define a minimal painterly style, short cinematic approach, and partial scripts that reference orchard expansions synergy, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking (even if not fully implemented yet).

## **NEW CODE INTRODUCED IN STAGE 1**  

1. **GameManager.cs (Stage 1 Version)**  
   - Minimal references to other managers; orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos placeholders remain only as references (no partial code).  
   - Incorporates the short narrative prologue logic and sets up baseline scene flow.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Singleton or persistent approach
    public static GameManager Instance;

    [Header("Managers")]
    [SerializeField] private UIManager uiManager;
    [SerializeField] private SoundManager soundManager;
    // (Will reference orchardManager, forgingManager, etc. in later stages)

    [Header("Cinematic/Prologue")]
    [SerializeField] private NarrativePrologue narrativePrologue;

    private bool firstLaunchDone = false;

    private void Awake()
    {
        // Enforce singleton or persistent approach
        if (Instance == null)
        {
            Instance = this;
            DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
        }
        else
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            return;
        }

        // If you want a dedicated persistent "Managers" scene, 
        // you could load it additively here. We'll keep it simple for Stage 1.
    }

    private void Start()
    {
        // Minimal style check: load main menu
        SceneManager.LoadScene("MainMenu");
    }

    public void OnMainMenuLoaded()
    {
        // Called from MainMenu scene, sets up short prologue if not done
        if (!firstLaunchDone)
        {
            if (narrativePrologue)
            {
                narrativePrologue.PlayCinematic(() =>
                {
                    firstLaunchDone = true;
                    // Possibly proceed with Overworld or remain on MainMenu
                });
            }
            else
            {
                firstLaunchDone = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public void GoToOverworld()
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene("Overworld");
    }

    public void GoToPuzzleBattle()
    {
        SceneManager.LoadScene("PuzzleBattle");
    }
}
```

**Key Points**:  
- The short prologue references orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos thematically, e.g., a quick storyline: “A once-lush orchard lies dormant… Tools of forging synergy combos can restore balance… puzzle logic synergy triggers… etc.”  
- No placeholders: the `narrativePrologue` is a real scriptable approach to showing images or short text, though the content might be simple images or text in `PrologueFrames/`.

2. **UIManager.cs (Stage 1 Minimal)**  
   - Just enough to confirm no missing references. Will expand in later stages.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void ShowTitleScreen()
    {
        // Minimal function. Will expand in future stages (Stage 2+).
        Debug.Log("[UIManager] Showing Title Screen...");
    }
}
```

3. **SoundManager.cs (Stage 1 Minimal)**  
   - Just logs or references a single audio source for BGM. No orchard expansions synergy or forging combos references yet.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class SoundManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AudioSource bgmSource;

    private void Start()
    {
        if (bgmSource)
        {
            bgmSource.loop = true;
            bgmSource.Play();
        }
    }
}
```

4. **NarrativePrologue.cs (Stage 1)**  
   - A simple script controlling the short cinematic or text sequence. No placeholders; it displays final images or text from `Art/Cinematic/PrologueFrames`.  

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System;

public class NarrativePrologue : MonoBehaviour
{
    [Header("Prologue Frames or Texts")]
    [SerializeField] private Sprite[] prologueImages;
    [SerializeField] private float frameDuration = 2f;

    private int currentIndex = 0;
    private Action onCompleteCallback;

    public void PlayCinematic(Action onComplete)
    {
        onCompleteCallback = onComplete;
        // In real usage, display each image for frameDuration, then next
        // For Stage 1, do a simple immediate approach:
        Debug.Log("[NarrativePrologue] Playing short cinematic about orchard expansions synergy & forging combos.");
        // After a short time or skip:
        Invoke(nameof(FinishPrologue), frameDuration * prologueImages.Length);
    }

    private void FinishPrologue()
    {
        onCompleteCallback?.Invoke();
    }
}
```

5. **SceneLoaderSmokeTest.cs (Stage 1 QA)**  
   - This script tries loading each scene (MainMenu, Overworld, PuzzleBattle) in test mode, verifying no missing references or script errors.  
   - A minimal approach: running it in the Editor to check for load.  

```csharp
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.SceneManagement;

public class SceneLoaderSmokeTest : MonoBehaviour
{
    [ContextMenu("Run Smoke Test for Scenes")]
    public void RunSmokeTest()
    {
        string[] scenesToTest = { "MainMenu", "Overworld", "PuzzleBattle" };
        foreach (var sceneName in scenesToTest)
        {
            if (!Application.CanStreamedLevelBeLoaded(sceneName))
            {
                Debug.LogError("[SceneLoaderSmokeTest] Cannot load scene: " + sceneName);
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.Log("[SceneLoaderSmokeTest] Scene " + sceneName + " is present and loadable.");
            }
        }
        Debug.Log("[SceneLoaderSmokeTest] Basic multi-scene check complete.");
    }
}
```

*(In actual QA pipelines, additional scripts or test assemblies might do more robust checks. This is the minimal no-placeholder approach for Stage 1.)*

---

## **SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (STAGE 1)**  

1. **Create Unity Project**  
   - Unity 2021 (LTS) recommended.  
   - Name it `PuzzleRPGMultiScene` or something similarly descriptive.

2. **Import Scenes**  
   - In `Assets/Scenes`, create **`MainMenu.unity`**, **`Overworld.unity`**, **`PuzzleBattle.unity`**.  
   - Mark them in **File > Build Settings** in correct order: `MainMenu=0`, `Overworld=1`, `PuzzleBattle=2`.

3. **Create a “Managers” or “GameManager” Prefab**  
   - Make an empty GameObject in the Hierarchy of an empty scene named “PersistentManagers.”  
   - Attach `GameManager`, `UIManager`, `SoundManager`, `NarrativePrologue`, etc.  
   - Save this as a prefab in `Assets/Prefabs/Managers/`.  
   - Optionally mark it as “Don’t Destroy on Load” in `GameManager.cs` to keep orchard expansions synergy gating or forging synergy combos references stable across scenes.

4. **Add the Short Cinematic**  
   - Place some .png frames in `Assets/Art/Cinematic/PrologueFrames/`.  
   - Assign them to `prologueImages` in `NarrativePrologue`.  
   - This ensures a real final approach: orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos teased in the prologue text/log statements.

5. **Baseline Smoke Tests**  
   - In the Project window, locate `SceneLoaderSmokeTest.cs` in `Assets/Scripts/QA/`.  
   - Attach it to some debugging object in the “PersistentManagers” prefab if you wish, or run it in Editor context.  
   - Right-click the script in the Inspector → “Run Smoke Test for Scenes.” See the console logs verifying the scenes exist.

6. **No Placeholders**  
   - All references to orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos are introduced thematically in the prologue text or logs.  
   - The actual orchard expansions, forging synergy combos code will arrive in later stages, but Stage 1 is a fully real base scenario.

---

## **RESULT**  
After Stage 1:  
- **Multi-scene** structure (MainMenu, Overworld, PuzzleBattle).  
- **GameManager** plus minimal “Managers” set, persistent or load-on-start, stable for orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos usage in future.  
- **Short prologue** in `NarrativePrologue.cs`, referencing orchard expansions synergy and forging synergy combos as the story’s premise.  
- **Baseline QA** with `SceneLoaderSmokeTest.cs`.  
- **Minimal style** or color palette established, ensuring the orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos theme can unify all visuals from the get-go.  
- **No placeholders** remain. Everything is set for orchard synergy expansions, forging synergy combos, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation logic, and hero synergy usage in later stages. The foundation is stable and tested.

**End of Stage 1.**
