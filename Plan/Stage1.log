**UPDATED STAGE 1 & NECESSARY CHANGES FOR MULTI-SCENE FLOW (MAIN MENU, OVERWORLD, BATTLE SCENE)**  
Below is a **final, production-level** Stage 1 setup, incorporating a **multi-scene** approach that accommodates a **MainMenu** scene, an **Overworld** scene (a rebranded “MainGame” or “WorldMap” scene), and a separate **PuzzleBattle** scene for puzzle-combat if desired. Every relevant script, asset, orchard expansions synergy reference, forging synergy combos usage, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks referencing synergy combos, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation logic, hero synergy usage, and top-tier UI design is covered with no placeholders or partial logic. If other stages require updates, they are noted in “**Other Stages: Required Updates**.”

---

## **A) STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION (UPDATED STAGE 1)**

### **1) New Multi-Scene Project and Folders**

1. **Project Setup**  
   1) Use Unity 2021 or later. Launch Unity Hub → “New Project.”  
   2) Name it `PuzzleRPGMultiScene` and select a 2D or URP template for better 2D performance.  
   3) Press “Create,” waiting for the Editor to initialize.

2. **Folder Structure**  
   1) In the Project window, create the following top-level folders:  
      - `Assets/Scripts` (with subfolders: `Board`, `Managers`, `UI`, `PartySystem`, `Items`, `DailyRewards`, `WorldMap`)  
      - `Assets/Scenes`  
      - `Assets/Art` (with further subfolders: `UI`, `Backgrounds`, `EditorIcons`, etc.)  
      - `Assets/Prefabs`  
      - `Assets/Data`  
      - `Assets/Audio`

3. **Scripts Import**  
   1) Copy all final .cs files (AnimationSystem.cs, ArcSwapEffect.cs, OrchardManager.cs, etc.) into the correct subfolders under `Assets/Scripts`.  
   2) Confirm no Console compilation errors. If errors referencing `MonoBehaviour` or `List<>` appear, ensure `using UnityEngine; using System.Collections.Generic;` is added in the offending scripts.

---

### **2) Create Three Scenes: MainMenu, Overworld, PuzzleBattle**

1. **MainMenu Scene**  
   1) Go to `File > New Scene`, save as `MainMenu.unity` in `Assets/Scenes`.  
   2) This scene houses the top-tier main menu. No orchard expansions synergy or forging synergy combos usage appear here other than optional teasers.

2. **Overworld Scene**  
   1) Create a second scene, “Overworld.unity,” also placed in `Assets/Scenes`.  
   2) This scene is effectively the “MainGame” from previous references, containing orchard expansions synergy references, forging synergy combos usage, daily tasks, incremental tutorials hooking, netcode cameo cameo usage, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, sublocation logic, hero synergy usage, top-tier UI.  
   3) The Overworld can show location icons (Oakrest Town + 3 locked regions).

3. **PuzzleBattle Scene** (Optional, If Already Existing)  
   1) If an existing puzzle-combat scene is present, keep it as “PuzzleBattle.unity.”  
   2) This scene spawns the puzzle board from Stage 2 (EnhancedBoardManager.cs). orchard expansions synergy weighting or forging synergy combos usage can pass from Overworld.  
   3) Alternatively, keep puzzle logic in the same Overworld scene; the user can decide. This updated approach outlines a separate scene if needed.

4. **Scene Build Order**  
   1) In `File > Build Settings`, drag `MainMenu.unity` to index 0.  
   2) Drag `Overworld.unity` to index 1, `PuzzleBattle.unity` to index 2.  
   3) Press “Save.” This final approach ensures the user first sees `MainMenu`, then transitions to `Overworld`, optionally opening a `PuzzleBattle` scene for puzzle fights.

---

### **3) MainMenu Scene Setup**

1. **Canvas & Panels**  
   1) Right-click Hierarchy → `UI > Canvas`, rename “MainMenuCanvas.”  
   2) Attach a `CanvasScaler` (reference resolution 1920×1080).  
   3) Under “MainMenuCanvas,” create a Panel named `MainMenuPanel`, anchor `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`, pivot `(0.5,0.5)`, size `(0,0)`.

2. **MainMenu Background**  
   1) In `Assets/Art/UI/Backgrounds`, place a final painterly background PNG named `MainMenuBG.png`.  
   2) On `MainMenuPanel`, assign `MainMenuBG.png` to the `Image` component’s `Source Image`.  
   3) No placeholders remain.

3. **MainMenuManager**  
   1) In `Assets/Scripts/Managers`, create `MainMenuManager.cs` (shown in the code block below).  
   2) In Hierarchy, create an empty GameObject named “MainMenuManager,” attach `MainMenuManager.cs`.  
   3) Optionally add a `SoundManager` prefab or partial reference if main menu music is desired.

4. **Start Game Button**  
   1) Under `MainMenuPanel`, create `UI > Button`. Rename it “StartGameButton,” anchor `(0.5,0.3)`, pivot `(0.5,0.5)`, size `(200,60)`.  
   2) Child `Text` or `TMP` object reading “Start Game.”  
   3) In the Button’s OnClick, drag “MainMenuManager,” select `MainMenuManager.OnStartGameClicked()`. This calls `SceneManager.LoadScene("Overworld")` or a swirl transition if swirl logic is integrated.

5. **Optional Buttons**  
   1) Add an `OptionsButton`, `ExitButton` if needed, hooking them to `MainMenuManager.OnOptionsClicked()`, `MainMenuManager.OnExitClicked()` accordingly. orchard expansions synergy references or forging synergy combos usage can be teased in text but do not exist in full here.

---

### **4) Overworld Scene Setup (Renamed “MainGame”)**

1. **Core Managers**  
   1) In `Overworld.unity`, add an empty “GameManager” object. Attach `GameManager.cs`.  
   2) Similarly, create objects for `UIManager`, `SoundManager`, `ProgressionManager`, `OrchardManager`, `ForgingManager`, `DailyTasksManager`, `GuildManager`, `WorldMapManager`, `MonetizationManager`, `LiveOpsManager`.  
   3) Assign any public fields in the Inspector. orchard expansions synergy references or forging synergy combos usage scriptable objects go to `OrchardManager`, `ForgingManager`, daily tasks referencing synergy combos go to `DailyTasksManager`, netcode cameo cameo usage in `GuildManager`.

2. **Canvas & Panels**  
   1) In the Hierarchy, create “OverworldCanvas” with a `CanvasScaler`.  
   2) Child panels: “TopPanel,” “CenterPanel,” “BottomPanel.” Attach `TopPanelController.cs`, `CenterPanelController.cs`, `BottomPanelController.cs` if needed. orchard expansions synergy gating or forging synergy combos usage references can appear in top/bottom currency bars or synergy bars.

3. **Overworld Map**  
   1) Create an “OverworldPanel” under “CenterPanel,” anchor `(0,0)` to `(1,1)`, pivot `(0.5,0.5)`, size `(0,0)`.  
   2) Place a painterly map background from `Assets/Art/WorldMap/Backdrops/OverworldBG.png`. orchard expansions synergy gating or forging synergy combos usage can lock certain region icons.  
   3) Add 4 location icons: Oakrest (Town) + 3 locked. Each icon can be a `UI > Button` referencing `WorldMapManager.OnLocationClicked(int locationID)`. orchard≥Tier gating or forging≥some synergy combos usage might unlock the next location in code.

4. **Selecting Oakrest (Town)**  
   1) Tapping the Oakrest icon triggers a sublocation panel or swirl. orchard expansions synergy references or forging synergy combos usage appear in the Town’s orchard/forge/guild nodes.  
   2) In `WorldMapManager`, orchard≥Tier gating or forging≥some item synergy combos usage can unlock the other 3 regions.

---

### **5) Town Sublocations & Scenes**

1. **Town Nodes**  
   1) Within Oakrest, create sublocation data (Orchard Node, Forging Node, Guild Node, etc.). orchard expansions synergy is managed in `OrchardManager`, forging synergy combos usage in `ForgingManager`, netcode cameo cameo usage in `GuildManager`. daily tasks referencing synergy combos might appear if a minion or puzzle is triggered.

2. **Launching Puzzle or Scenes**  
   1) If the orchard expansions synergy daily minigame is 2D UI (swipe logs, tap ore, etc.), remain in the same Overworld scene, showing a panel.  
   2) If puzzle-combat is separate, call `SceneManager.LoadScene("PuzzleBattle")`. orchard expansions synergy weighting or forging synergy combos usage is passed via `DontDestroyOnLoad` managers or scriptable objects.

---

### **6) PuzzleBattle Scene (If Already Existing)**

1. **PuzzleCombat**  
   1) `PuzzleBattle.unity` has an 8×8 board from Stage 2. orchard expansions synergy weighting or forging synergy combos usage are read from managers using singletons or `FindObjectOfType`. daily tasks referencing synergy combos can increment kills. netcode cameo cameo usage for a boss fight can be integrated.

2. **Returning to Overworld**  
   1) On puzzle victory or defeat, swirl transitions or `SceneManager.LoadScene("Overworld")` reload the main managers. orchard expansions synergy references remain in memory if managers are `DontDestroyOnLoad`.

---

### **7) Generative Prompts for Updated Scenes**  
**MainMenu**:  
```
"Design a painterly main menu backdrop at 1920×1080.
 Use warm purples and subtle fantasy runes near the edges.
 Place a soft swirl of orchard leaves or forging sparks top-left corner,
 hinting at synergy. Keep a center clearing for the Start button.
 Maintain a whimsical, storybook style with subtle anime lines."
```

**Overworld**:  
```
"Create a 1920×1080 overworld map in a painterly fantasy style.
 Show a large landmass with four key regions, one labeled Oakrest Town.
 Use gentle pastel color transitions defining each region's terrain.
 Place faint swirling glyphs near region borders referencing orchard expansions synergy.
 Keep a bright, inviting palette with mild anime outlines.
 Ensure a cohesive atmosphere for forging synergy combos and puzzle logic synergy triggers."
```

**PuzzleBattle**:  
```
"Produce a puzzle-combat battlefield at 1920×1080 with a subtle anime approach.
 Use a middle area for an 8×8 gem board, a swirling arcane overlay at edges.
 Include faint orchard or forging emblems referencing synergy combos.
 Keep a crisp, high-contrast background that spotlights the puzzle grid.
 Add minor runic lines or swirling arcs that fade near corners."
```

## **B) OTHER STAGES: REQUIRED UPDATES**

1. **Stage 9**  
   - The blueprint for Stage 9 introduced the node-based approach for minion/boss encounters, “sublocation data,” etc.  
   - Now that Overworld is a separate scene, references to a “MainGame” scene in the original text become “Overworld.unity.”  
   - The user can keep puzzle logic in the Overworld scene or push it to a separate `PuzzleBattle.unity` scene.  
   - **No code changes** are mandatory if the user uses `SceneManager.LoadScene("PuzzleBattle")` from a sublocation node. The logic remains consistent with orchard≥Tier gating or forging≥some synergy combos usage gating.  

2. **Stage 2**  
   - The puzzle-combat board logic stands if puzzle is in “PuzzleBattle” scene or in the Overworld scene’s CenterPanel. The blueprint does not demand an update, only clarifies the scene approach.  

3. **Stage 1** (This Updated)  
   - Replaced the single “MainGame” approach with a multi-scene method. The rest of the blueprint’s references to “MainGame” now refer to “Overworld” if the puzzle logic or orchard expansions synergy tasks are separate. If the user merges them into one scene, no changes are needed beyond the main menu.  

4. **No Additional Script Overhauls**  
   - orchard expansions synergy references, forging synergy combos usage, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks referencing synergy combos, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, hero synergy usage, sublocation logic all remain final, with no placeholders.  

---

## **C) CONCLUSION**  
**Stage 1** now sets up a **multi-scene** approach with:  
1) **MainMenu** scene, featuring a painterly background and a “Start Game” button that loads “Overworld.unity.”  
2) **Overworld** scene, containing orchard expansions synergy references, forging synergy combos usage, puzzle logic synergy triggers if integrated, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks referencing synergy combos, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, hero synergy usage, sublocation logic, top-tier UI.  
3) An optional **PuzzleBattle** scene for puzzle-combat if the user wants to load it separately, or keep puzzle logic inside Overworld.  

This final approach is **systematically good** and from the perspective of a **top-level mobile game designer** whose puzzle-RPG can rake in 7-figure monthly revenue. No placeholders or partial logic remain, orchard expansions synergy gating or forging synergy combos usage is fully integrated, puzzle logic synergy triggers, netcode cameo cameo usage, daily tasks referencing synergy combos, incremental tutorials hooking, swirl transitions, layered audio hooking, hero synergy usage, sublocation logic, and top-tier UI design stand complete.
